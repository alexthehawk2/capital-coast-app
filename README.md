# Project Title : Capital Coast App

This is a project I made while trying to learn responsive design patterns using Tailwind CSS and ReactJS.

# Description 

This is a project which I created while learning about modern react responsive designs. 

I used Javascript Mastery's Project Hoobank as inspiration while designing this site.

I have not coded along with his project and created this site from scratch while reading the Tailwind CSS documentation.

I intend to build a Full-Stack bank application in addition to this landing page in future.

Vite is used as a toolchain for creation of this project.
